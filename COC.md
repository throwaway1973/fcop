# Fantasyland Institute of Learning - Code Of Professionalism

Copyright &copy; 2016 Fantasyland Institute of Learning. All Rights Reserved.

## Statement of Purpose

The Fantasyland Institute of Learning Code of Professionalism (FCOP) dictates the terms and conditions under which we allow you to participate in the _community_.

The purpose of FCOP is to ensure both inclusiveness and productivity in a pluralistic society. To accomplish this goal, we restrict the _community_ to _civil_ people, and protect such people from _discrimination_, _stereotyping_, _harassment_, _judgmental communication_, and _breaches of privacy_.

FCOP is explicitly not intended to impose any system of politics, religion, ideologies, morals, or values onto _members_.

## Short-Form

We welcome all _civil_ people to participate in the _community_. We do not allow _discrimination_, _harassment_, _judgmental communication_, or _breaches of privacy_. We do not exclude any _civil_ people from our _community_ unless they have demonstrated an inability to follow our terms and conditions.

## Welcome Statement

We welcome _civil_ people of all genders, gender-expressions, sexual-orientations, gender-orientations, races, ethnic origins, skin colors, physical handicaps, mental handicaps, ages, sizes, political views, religious views, philosophies, beliefs, and attitudes.

We pledge that we will not tolerate _discrimination_, _harassment_, _judgmental communication_, or _breaches of privacy_. We pledge to hold ourselves to these same standards and, in so doing, set a positive example for others to follow.

We greatly value integrity and pledge to establish the highest levels of trust in _members_.

## Behavior

### Active Participation

During _active participation_, you must behave as described in this section.

* **Don't Stereotype**. Treat everyone as unique. Do not infer characteristics of a person based on their [perceived] membership in some group or category.
* **Don't Communicate Judgmentally**. You must not communicate the idea that any person, place, thing, idea, or action is superior or inferior to any other. Instead, talk about observations, models, analyses, and your own personal preferences.
* **Don't Harass**. Do not interact with anyone who does not consent. For verbal and written interaction you may assume consent for the first interaction, until the recipient communicates otherwise. For physical interaction, close physical proximity, and persistent gaze, you must assume non-consent until the person clearly and unambiguously communicates otherwise.
* **Don't Pry**. Do not go out of your way to read, watch, or listen to the private communications of other members (including trying to read their screens or listening to their private conversations). If you do read or overhear a private conversation, do not share it.
* **Don't Obstruct**. Do not attempt to disrupt communication between members, the activity of members, or the congregation of members.
* **Assume the Best**. Assume the best intention when others communicate with you. If you don’t understand what someone meant, or have questions about it, ask them directly rather than speculating or spreading rumors. If someone appears to be communicating judgmentally ("Coffee is good"), assume they did so only as a shorthand way of speaking, and ask them to clarify what objective metrics and subjective preferences they are implying ("I like coffee").

### Inactive Participation

During _inactive participation_, you must behave as described in this section.

* **Be Civil**. Do not engage in criminal activity, and do not sabotage FCOP _communities_ or _member_'s careers for political, religious, ideological, or moral reasons.
* **Don't Dox**. Do not disseminate any private details about others learned within the _community_ without express permission, including but not limited to real name, address, phone number, or photo identity.
* **Don't Shame**. You must not negatively discuss a member's behavior inside the _community_ outside of the _community_ without express permission, where discussed _members_ themselves decide what is negative.

## Privacy

**Private Communication**. During _active participation_, you may take phone calls, direct messages, emails, and other semi-private forms of communication. Although private communication is not bound by FCOP, we expect all communication that can be seen or overheard by other members will comply with the requirements of FCOP.

**Private Consumption**. During _active participation_, you may consume material on your own personal devices and from your own channels of communication, and this material does not have to conform to FCOP, assuming the material is not easily discernible to others.

## Violations

**No Victimless Crime**. If you are a _victim_ but you do not feel victimized, you may choose to not report the _violation_. In this case, we will not treat the incident as a violation.

**Reporting Process**. _Active participation_ violations must be reported to us within 15 days by Victims. Inactive Participation violations may be reported at any time, and by anyone, even non-_members_.

**Unofficial Resolution**. For minor offenses and in cases where they prefer doing so, we encourage _victims_ to speak to _violators_, using the language of non-violent communication (NVC). If you would like to do this with the help of an independent mediator, contact us and we will arrange for one.

**Official Resolution**. If you want an official intervention, we will appoint a judge. The judge will speak individually to all parties, including witnesses, before deciding on a course of action, which will involve rejecting the reported violation, or accepting it and imposing a penalty on the _violator_.

**Penalties**. _Violators_ may be warned, asked to apologize, forced into training, counseling or mediation, or ejected and banned from the _community_, at the sole discretion of the judge.

**Social Rehabilitation**. No one can be banished for life, only for a determined number of years, not to exceed 5 years. Formerly banned parties can be reintegrated into the _community_ through a rehabilitation process determined by us.

**Confidentiality**. Reporting a violation is a confidential process. We will not publish information on any reported incident or the parties involved in the incident. Note that criminal behavior of any kind will not be kept confidential.

## Terms

 * **Active Participation**. We define Active Participation to include the behavior of members while they are in the boundaries of the _community_.
 * **Behavior**. We define behavior to include all and only observable actions of people, and to explicitly exclude any private thoughts, beliefs, ideas, attitudes, morals, and emotions.
 * **Civil**. We define civil individuals as individuals who, in our sole estimation, do not and will not engage in the following behaviors:

    * **Crimes**. Any criminal behavior in which there is a victim.
    * **Community Sabotage**. Any behavior (excluding non-violent communication) directed at sabotaging FCOP communities for political, religious, ideological, or moral reasons.
    * **Professional Sabotage**. Any behavior directed at sabotaging a _member_'s career for political, religious, ideological, or moral reasons; including attempting to no-platform a _member_ or pressuring an employer to fire a _member_.
 * **Communication**. We define communication as any transmission of information between people, including but not limited to verbal, written, electronic, pictorial, gestural, and tactile.
 * **Community**. We define our _community_ as a group of people with a shared professional interest that exists at some location (online or geographical) and within some span of time.

 * **Judgmental Communication**. We define _judgmental communication_ as any communication which asserts or implies that something has intrinsic superiority or inferiority. This includes all forms of name-calling, but explicitly excludes any language that qualifies as non-violent communication (NVC).
 * **Members**. We define a member of the _community_ as a _civil_ individual who we allow to actively participate in the _community_.

    * **Judgmental Communication**. Someone has _communicated judgmentally_ about them, their beliefs, their ideas, their religion, their morals, their values, or things they own or use; or someone has done so about a group to which they belong to.
    * **Breaches of Privacy**. Someone has violated their privacy.
 * **Violator**. We define _violator_ as someone who has broken the terms and conditions of FCOP.
 * **We**. We define "we" to be those who have the actual or legal ability to impose FCOP-prescribed penalties on _violators_ within the physical or virtual boundaries of the _community_.
